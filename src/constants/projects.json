    "description": "Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning is a project that predicts stock prices and trends by analyzing historical data, technical indicators, and financial metrics. Using algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, it forecasts future stock prices. The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). For example, the model might show an RMSE of 0.35 and an accuracy of 85% for stock predictions. Data from sources like Yahoo Finance and Quandl is processed to train the model, helping investors make informed, data-driven decisions.",
